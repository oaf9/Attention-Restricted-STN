# Attention-Restricted-STN
A Module that implements Spacial Transformer Networks with an Attention Restriction mechanism. This is useful in computer vision problems where images are warped or otherwise subject to deformities (e.g. in video footage). This can also be referenced as a manual for implementing an STN over the Pytorch framework. The model is definied in sp_module.py. DataSet.py defines a custom dataset class, and train.py defines a training class.  THe model is built over the Pytorch framework and supports GPU acceleration.
